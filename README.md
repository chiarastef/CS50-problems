# Problems from CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science

[CS50 (Computer Science 50)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University and Yale University. It teaches the languages C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the Flask web framework and fundamental computer-science concepts including arrays and data structures.

From the CS50 website:
> Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.
